# Key Insights
- Print circulation declined structurally after COVID, falling from 35M to ~28M copies by 2024.
- 2022 recorded the sharpest year-on-year drop in circulation (–6.3%), marking the peak impact of COVID.
- High-circulation cities were hit hardest and have not returned to pre-pandemic levels.
- Tier 2 states experienced the steepest decline in newspaper sales.
- Ad revenue rebounded by ₹20M by 2024, proving advertiser confidence despite lower print volume.
- Digital pilot programs show high early churn (66%), indicating weak retention.
- Ahmedabad and Lucknow outperform in digital adoption despite lower marketing spend.
- Higher marketing spend does not ensure higher engagement, as efficiency is lowest in the most expensive digital program.

# Recommendations
- Transition to a digital-first growth strategy while gradually reducing dependency on print circulation.
- Prioritize high-performing digital cities such as Ahmedabad, Bhopal, and Lucknow for scaling.
- Strengthen and scale the Mobile App Beta as the core digital platform.
- Optimize marketing spend using ROI and engagement metrics rather than increasing budgets.
- Protect print operations only in resilient cities and exit low-return markets to improve profitability.
